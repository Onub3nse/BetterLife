# BetterLife 0.5c
Captain of Industry MOD. Some modifications and new assets to make life easier.
Some features still in devlopment. Coming soon.

Important update to the mod.

The mod has been split into 3 parts, for those who don't want all the features in a single mod.

# Buildings

Custom buildings, for now, a McDonalds, more to come.

# Roads And Signs

Huge overhaul to roads, new designs, pieces, and "real" roads (thanks to Mafi and Update 3).

# Better Assembler

Custom assembler 1 and 2, with custom recipes (the recipes got nerfed a bit, now you need massive transports to be able to feed the machines).

# Research Overhaul, now all the mod related reseach has been moved to the uppder part of the research tree.
  Added some requirements to the research.


# Installation:

            Look for a folder in your system drive like this:

            Unzip to that folder, you should see something like:
